Professional Experiences
Graduate Teaching Assistant, University of North Dakota – Grand Forks, ND, USA August 2022 – Present 
(academic-year only)
• Assisted in instruction for Physiology of Organs and Systems, Histology, Cell Biology, Developmental Biology, and 
Introduction to Biology (courses for Majors and non-Majors)
• Prepared laboratory equipment and materials; guided students through physiological experiments and data interpretation.
• Graded laboratory assignments, providing constructive feedback to enhance analytical and critical thinking skills.
• Facilitated active learning assignments founded in primary literature, including support for development of and assesment 
for student presentations on course-based projects.
Graduate Research Assistant, University of North Dakota – Grand Forks, ND, USA May 2025 – Aug 2025
Nanoparticle TEM segmentation and Nanoremediation project
• Developed a transmission electron microscopy (TEM)-based analysis pipeline to conduct nanoparticle morphometric 
quantification, incorporating pixel-based classification using Trainable Weka Segmentation and Python-based image 
analysis of size, shape, and eccentricity metrics. This pipeline has been used to quantify differences across nanomaterials 
synthesis approaches with distinct compositions. The data generated from the novel approach that I developed are 
currently part of two manuscripts in preparation.
• Collaborated on a research project titled, “Nanozymes: Promising Frontiers in Detection and Nanoremediation of 
Environmental Pollutants”. For this work, I conducted the primary literature meta-analysis; wrote the “Computational 
Approaches” section on nanozyme design for environmental remediation, detailing applications of Density Functional 
Theory, machine learning, and deep learning in catalytic optimization, and designed the publication’s graphical abstract 
illustrating experimental and computational integration. I am the 2nd author on this manuscript that is currently in review.
Retinal Image Analysis
• Completed Advanced Topics in Biomedical Sciences Imaging course, where my class project focused on quantitative 
analysis of astrocyte reactivity in Alzheimer’s disease models. I developed an image-analysis workflow using ROI-based 
preprocessing, noise reduction, and Trainable Weka segmentation to quantify GFAP-positive astrocytes in AppNL-G-F mouse 
hippocampal tissue. The project demonstrated elevated GFAP expression in AD mice and illustrated how computational 
imaging can reveal neuroinflammatory signatures relevant to disease progression.
• Performed mouse retina microdissection and prepared retinal whole mounts for immunolabelling to detect neural, glial 
and vascular cell populations in Wild-type and AD mice.
• Processed images in Fiji/ImageJ, which included noise subtraction, background correction, brightness/contrast adjustment, 
and channel splitting. I applied Ilastik pixel-classification segmentation and refined the resulting masks by removing 
artifacts in Fiji.
• Conducted quantitative analyses including Sholl-based branching measurements, branch-point detection from binarized 
masks, and tortuosity quantification using Python packages (scikit-image, skan, NumPy).
• Calculated vessel density by merging ROI polygons into a unified tissue mask. Then, generated thresholded vessel images 
and computed vessel density from calibrated vessel-area measurements. Verified mask accuracy through quality-control 
overlays in Fiji and Python.
